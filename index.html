		<li><h2>Congressional Party Voting Rates and Prevalence of Primary Contenders</h2>
				<h3><i>Question: Does voting with or against your party affect the likelihood of facing a same-party candidate in the primaries?</i></h3>
				<p>
					I am interested in exploring how voting records affect party image, measured by chance of having a same-party contender in the primary, for members of congress, by using external ratings of a congressmanâ€™s voting record (i.e., National Journal, interest groups, more 'biased' sources).

		<li><h2>Med School Specialization and Starting Salary</h2>
			<h3><i>Question: How does the amount of student loan debt affect the specializations that medical students choose?</i></h3>
			<p>
				In recent years, there has a been a trend in medical school of hyper-specialization, by which I mean no one goes into primary care practice anymore. <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262033.php" target="_blank">This article</a> from June 17, 2013 details the issue. There are many possible factors that could affect this trend such as: student loans when starting medical school, average cost of medical school, current interest rates, average length of residencies, average length of fellowships, and starting attending salary. I want to crunch the data and see if there is a correlation between student loan debt and choosing a highly-paid specialty.

			<li><h2>Mental Health and Urbanism</h2>
				<h3><i>Question: What affect does living in an urban environment have on mental health?</i></h3>
				<p>
					I am highly interested in the intersection between mental health and city living. I have been thinking about this topic recently for a few reasons. First, due to the horrible NYC winter I have just experienced, I began to look into the number of sunny days in major metro areas throughout the country. I want to continue this by looking into rates of depression within these cities. Additionally, inspired by this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/theres-something-about-cities-and-suicide/283975/" target="_blank">Atlantic article</a> from last week, I want to delve more into the idea that cities can curb rates of suicide. I want to explore the relationship between mental health (rates of suicide, depression, etc.) and population size.
