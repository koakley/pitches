	<h2>Congressional Party Voting Rates and Prevalence of Primary Contenders</h2>
				<h3><i>Question: Does voting with or against your party affect the likelihood of facing a same-party candidate in the primaries?</i></h3>
				<h3>Potential Headline: "Every vote against your own party makes it ?? percent more likely you get a primary challenger"</h3>
				<p>
					I am interested in exploring how voting records affect party image, measured by chance of having a same-party contender in the primary, for members of congress, by using external ratings of a congressmanâ€™s voting record (i.e., National Journal, interest groups, more 'biased' sources). Specifically I want to see if there is a correlation between voting against your party and the percent chance of having a primary contender.

				<h3>Data Links:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-vote-ratings" target="_blank">National Journal Voting Records and Rates</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://congress.freedomworks.org/" target="_blank">FreedomWorks Congressional Scorecards</a></li>
						<li>Campaign and Member pages for voting records and awards for voting records</li>
						<li>Other interest groups for member ratings</li>
						<li>Majority/Minority speaker/whip pages for voting records</li>
					</ul>

					<p>	Based on feedback, I will need to focus on the following data sources: a list of votes for congressional members, their party, how their party voted, a complete list of primary candidates and whether it's a serious challenge.
